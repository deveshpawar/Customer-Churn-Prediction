# Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Description

This project aims to develop a customer churn prediction system that helps businesses identify and retain customers who are at risk of leaving. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can forecast potential churners, allowing companies to take proactive measures and reduce customer attrition.

## System Architecture

Our customer churn prediction system follows a data-driven approach. The architecture includes:

- Data Collection from kaggle.
- Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, Featyure Importance.
- Machine Learning Models, including Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
- Model Evaluation using various performance metrics.
- K-Fold Cross-Validation.
- Deployment, allowing users to make predictions.

## Getting Started

To use this system, follow these steps:
- run stream_app.py
